excerpt: 'The formation of multi-protein complexes is a key feature of the cellular proteome in all kingdoms of life. The biogenesis of protein complexes in vivo is still poorly understood, but recent methodological advances now make it possible to reveal the underlying mechanisms. One milestone method, termed Selective Ribosome Profiling (SeRP), allowed to demonstrate the omnipresence of co-translational assembly in bacteria and yeast (Shieh et al. 2015, Shiber et al. 2018). This method provides codon-resolved information about heterodimer formation between already completed and folded proteins and their nascent partner subunits (termed co-post assembly). The fact that assembly can occur during translation raised the question whether co-translational assembly could also involve interaction between two nascent proteins translated by two neighboring ribosomes (termed co-co assembly). So far, indirect evidence suggested co-co assembly of only a few protein complexes. However, direct evidence that two ribosome-nascent chain complexes interact via their nascent chains is still scarce and we lack any information about the prevalence of this proposed process.'
