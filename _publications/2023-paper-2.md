excerpt: 'The sGC is a heterodimeric protein complex composed of one alpha and one beta-subunit and is widely expressed in different human and animal tissues. Complex formation is obligate for enzymatic activity. The aim of this project was to investigate if the assembly of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) occurs co-translationally.'
