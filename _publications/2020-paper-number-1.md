excerpt: 'Translation regulation occurs largely during the initiation phase. Here, we develop selective 40S footprinting to visualize initiating 40S ribosomes on endogenous mRNAs in vivo. This reveals the positions on mRNAs where initiation factors join the ribosome to act and where they leave. We discover that in most human cells, most scanning ribosomes remain attached to the 50 cap. Consequently, only one ribosome scans a 50 UTR at a time, and 50 UTR length affects translation efficiency. We discover that eukaryotic initiation factor 3B (eIF3B,) eIF4G1, and eIF4E remain bound to 80S ribosomes as they begin translating, with a decay half-length of ~12 codons. Hence, ribosomes retain these initiation factors while translating short upstream open reading frames (uORFs), providing an explanation for how ribosomes can reinitiate translation after uORFs in humans. This method will be of use for studying translation initiation mechanisms in vivo.'

excerpt: 'The majority of cellular proteins exerts their biological activity as oligomeric complexes. The general view was that complexes form by random collision of folded subunits in the cytosol. Recent studies question this view by demonstrating that a surprisingly high number of complexes are formed during translation. Co-translational assembly occurs by interaction either of fully synthesized subunits with nascent partner subunits, or of two nascent polypeptides exposed by proximal ribosomes.'

excerpt: 'The formation of multi-protein complexes is a key feature of the cellular proteome in all kingdoms of life. The biogenesis of protein complexes in vivo is still poorly understood, but recent methodological advances now make it possible to reveal the underlying mechanisms. One milestone method, termed Selective Ribosome Profiling (SeRP), allowed to demonstrate the omnipresence of co-translational assembly in bacteria and yeast (Shieh et al. 2015, Shiber et al. 2018). This method provides codon-resolved information about heterodimer formation between already completed and folded proteins and their nascent partner subunits (termed co-post assembly). The fact that assembly can occur during translation raised the question whether co-translational assembly could also involve interaction between two nascent proteins translated by two neighboring ribosomes (termed co-co assembly). So far, indirect evidence suggested co-co assembly of only a few protein complexes. However, direct evidence that two ribosome-nascent chain complexes interact via their nascent chains is still scarce and we lack any information about the prevalence of this proposed process.'

excerpt: 'The sGC is a heterodimeric protein complex composed of one alpha and one beta-subunit and is widely expressed in different human and animal tissues. Complex formation is obligate for enzymatic activity. The aim of this project was to investigate if the assembly of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) occurs co-translationally.'
