Trained molecular biologist and data analyst, I obtained my PhD degree 2021 from the Ruprecht-Karls University in Heidelberg working with [Bernd Bukau](https://www.zmbh.uni-heidelberg.de/Bukau/) under the supervision of GÃ¼nter Kramer at the ZMBH. From 2021 on, I am a postdoc in the lab of [Lars Steinmetz](https://www.embl.org/groups/steinmetz/) at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg. The EIPOD postdoc fellowship allows me to be associated and work also at EMBL Hamburg with [Matthias Wilmanns](https://www.embl.org/groups/wilmanns/) and with [Janosch Hennig](https://www.embl.org/groups/hennig/), who is now at the University of Bayreuth. An add-on exchange grant from the life science alliance gave me the opportunity to work as a visiting researcher for 3 months in the lab of [Victoria Parikh](https://profiles.stanford.edu/victoria-parikh) in Stanford. 

My general research interest is centered around the development of high-throughput DNA/RNA sequencing methods to understand fundamental molecular processes in human cells. I love to work in collaborative teams to unfold the full potential of the scientific world.  My main focus is always to generate new data and to analyze them myself. My current research resolves around the question how genetic mutations affect phenotypic outcomes in cardiomyocytes (see [Research section](https://kaifenzl.github.io/portfolio/) for more).

I want to continue my academic path and become an independent group leader, which will allow me to build my own friendly, productive and collaborative work environment. I am looking forward to these new challenges in the upcoming future.
